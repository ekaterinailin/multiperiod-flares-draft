     abstract = "{Context. Magnetic fields in cool stars can be investigated by measuring
        Zeeman line broadening and polarization in atomic and molecular
        lines. Similar to the Sun, these fields are complex and height-
        dependent. Many molecular lines dominating M-dwarf spectra
        (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature- and Zeeman-
        sensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes
        them excellent probes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs.
        \textbackslash Aims: Our goal is to analyze the complexity of
        magnetic fields in M dwarfs. We investigate how magnetic fields
        vary with the stellar temperature and how ``surface''
        inhomogeneities are distributed in height - the dimension that
        is usually neglected in stellar magnetic studies. \textbackslash
        Methods: We have determined effective temperatures of the
        photosphere and of magnetic features, magnetic field strengths
        and filling factors for nine M dwarfs (M1-M7). Our
        {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$ analysis is based on a comparison of
        observed and synthetic intensity and circular polarization
        profiles. Stokes profiles were calculated by solving polarized
        radiative transfer equations. \textbackslash Results: Properties
        of magnetic structures depend on the analyzed atomic or
        molecular species and their formation heights. Two types of
        magnetic features similar to those on the Sun have been found: a
        cooler (starspots) and a hotter (network) one. The magnetic
        field strength in both starspots and network is within 3-6 kG,
        on average it is 5 kG. These fields occupy a large fraction of M
        dwarf atmospheres at all heights, up to 100\%. The plasma
        {\ensuremath{\beta}} is less than one, implying highly
        magnetized stars. \textbackslash Conclusions: A combination of
        molecular and atomic species and a simultaneous analysis of
        intensity and circular polarization spectra have allowed us to
        better decipher the complexity of magnetic fields on M dwarfs,
        including their dependence on the atmospheric height. This work
        provides an opportunity to investigate a larger sample of M
        dwarfs and L-type brown dwarfs. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe

        and we examined its potential for estimating magnetic fields on
        stars and substellar objects, such as brown dwarfs and hot
        exoplanets. \textbackslash Methods: We carried out quantum
        mechanical calculations to obtain the energy level structure of
        the electronic-vibrational-rotational states considered both in
        the absence and in the presence of a magnetic field. Level
        mixing due to magnetic field perturbation (the Paschen-Back
        effect) was consistently taken into account. Then, we calculated
        frequencies and strengths of transitions between magnetic
        sublevels. Employing these results and solving numerically a set
        of the radiative transfer equations for polarized radiation, we
        calculated Stokes parameters for both the individual lines and
        the (0,0) band depending on the strength and orientation of the

        magnetic splitting of the individual CrH lines shows a
        significant asymmetry due to the Paschen-Back effect already at
        1 G field. This leads to a considerable signal in both circular
        and linear polarization, up to 30\% at the magnetic field
        strength of {\ensuremath{\geq}}3 kG in early L dwarfs. The
        polarization does not cancel out completely even at very low
        spectral resolution and is seen as broad-band polarization of a
        few percent. Since the line asymmetry depends only on the
        magnetic field strength and not on the filling factor, CrH lines
        provide a very sensitive tool for direct measurement of the
        stellar magnetic fields on faint cool objects, such as brown
        dwarfs and hot Jupiters, observed with low spectral resolution.}",

        flow of energy from the stellar interior outwards to the surface
        and consequently appear as locally cool and therefore dark
        regions against an otherwise bright photosphere (Biermann in
        Astronomische Nachrichten 264:361, 1938; Z Astrophysik 25:135,
        1948). As such, starspots are observable tracers of the yet
        unknown internal dynamo activity and allow a glimpse into the
        complex internal stellar magnetic field structure. Starspots
        also enable the precise measurement of stellar rotation which is
        among the key ingredients for the expected internal magnetic
        topology. But whether starspots are just blown-up sunspot
        analogs, we do not know yet. This article is an attempt to
        review our current knowledge of starspots. A comparison of a
        white-light image of the Sun (G2V, 5 Gyr) with a Doppler image

        with a scaling of the solar model, even for a star of same mass
        and effective temperature. Starspots, their surface location and
        migration pattern, and their link with the stellar dynamo and
        its internal energy transport, may have far reaching impact also
        for our understanding of low-mass stellar evolution and

        of 10 km s$^{-1}$ on average, radial velocity surveys targeting
        this stellar population will likely need to find methods to
        effectively remove starspot jitter. We present the first high
        resolution Doppler images of the M4.5 dwarf, GJ 791.2A, and the
        M9 dwarf, LP 944-20. The time series spectra of both objects
        reveal numerous line profile distortions over the rotation
        period of each star, which we interpret as starspots. The

        ratios that correspond to model atmosphere temperature
        differences of \{T\}$_{\{phot}$\}-\{T\}$_{\{spot}$\} = 300 and
        200 K. GJ 791.2A is a fully convective star with v sin i = 35.1

        contrast spots at predominantly high latitudes, which we see in
        both targets here, is, in general, likely to be responsible for
        the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-M dwarfs.
        For GJ 791.2A, the radial velocities induced by the starspot

        transits, for a total of 188 transits observed at 3.6 or 4.5
        $\mu$m. We also analyzed 29 occultations (secondary eclipses) of
        planet b and eight occultations of planet c observed at 4.5
        $\mu$m to constrain the brightness temperatures of their
        daysides. We identify several orphan transit-like structures in
        our Spitzer photometry, but all of them are of low significance.
        We do not confirm any new transiting planets. We estimate for

        $\sim$35 and 25 ppm in channels 1 and 2 of Spitzer/IRAC,

        origins and due to the large inter-pixel inhomogeneity of IRAC
        InSb arrays, and that the much better interpixel homogeneity of
        JWST instruments should result in noise floors as low as 10ppm,
        which is low enough to enable the atmospheric characterization
        of the planets by transit transmission spectroscopy. We
        construct updated broadband transmission spectra for all seven
        planets which show consistent transit depths between the two
        Spitzer channels. We identify and model five distinct high

        dwarfs with similar rotation rates. We secured high cadence
        spectral time series observations of the 5.5 au separation
        binary GJ 65, comprising GJ 65A (M5.5V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.24 d) and
        GJ 65B (M6V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.23 d). We also present new
        observations of GJ 791.2A (M4.5V, P$_{rot}$ = 0.31 d).
        Observations of each star were made on two nights with UVES,
        covering a wavelength range from 0.64 - 1.03{\ensuremath{\mu}}m.
        The time series spectra reveal multiple line distortions that we
        interpret as cool star-spots and which are persistent on both
        nights suggesting stability on the time-scale of 3 d. Spots are
        recovered with resolutions down to 8.3{\textdegree} at the
        equator. The global spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar
        to observations made a year earlier. Similar high latitude and
        circumpolar spot structure is seen on GJ 791.2A and GJ 65A.
        However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which instead
        reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at
        intermediate latitudes. All three stars show small amplitude
        latitude-dependent rotation that is consistent with solid body

     abstract = "{The nearby red dwarf binary GJ65 AB (UV+BL Ceti, M5.5Ve+M6Ve) is a
        cornerstone system to probe the physics of very low-mass stars.
        The radii of the two stars are currently known only from
        indirect photometric estimates, however, and this prevents us
        from using GJ65 AB as calibrators for the mass-radius (M-R)
        relation. We present new interferometric measurements of the
        angular diameters of the two components of GJ65 with the
        VLTI/PIONIER instrument in the near-infrared H band:
        {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{UD}$(A) = 0.558 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.008
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.020 mas and {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{UD}$(B)
        = 0.539 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.009 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.020 mas.
        They translate into limb-darkened angular diameters of
        {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{LD}$(A) = 0.573 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.021
        mas and {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{LD}$(B) = 0.554
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.022 mas. Based on the known parallax, the
        linear radii are R(A) = 0.165 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.006 R$_{☉}$
        and R(B) = 0.159 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.006 R$_{☉}$
        ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}(R) /R = 4\%). We searched for the
        signature of flares and faint companions in the interferometric
        visibilities and closure phases, but we did not identify any
        significant signal. We also observed GJ65 with the VLT/NACO
        adaptive optics and refined the orbital parameters and infrared
        magnitudes of the system. We derived masses for the two
        components of m(A) = 0.1225 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0043 M$_{☉}$
        and m(B) = 0.1195 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.0043 M$_{☉}$
        ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}(m) /m = 4\%). To derive the radial and
        rotational velocities of the two stars as well as their relative
        metallicity with respect to Proxima, we also present new
        individual UVES high-resolution spectra of the two components.
        Placing GJ65 A and B in the mass-radius diagram shows that their
        radii exceed expectations from recent models by 14
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 4\% and 12 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 4\%,
        respectively. Following previous theories, we propose that this
        discrepancy is caused by the inhibition of convective energy
        transport by a strong internal magnetic field generated by
        dynamo effect in these two fast-rotating stars. A comparison
        with the almost identical twin Proxima, which is rotating
        slowly, strengthens this hypothesis because the radius of
        Proxima does not appear to be inflated compared to models.

        and characterizing habitable planets in the solar neighborhood.
        However, the ultraviolet (UV) radiation emitted by such stars
        can erode and modify planetary atmospheres over time,
        drastically affecting their habitability. Thus, knowledge of the
        UV evolution of low-mass stars is critical for interpreting the
        evolutionary history of any orbiting planets. Shkolnik \& Barman
        used photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) to
        show how UV emission evolves for early-type M stars ($\gt$0.35 M
        $_{☉}$). In this paper, we extend their work to include both a
        larger sample of low-mass stars with known ages as well as M
        stars with lower masses. We find clear evidence that mid- and
        late-type M stars (0.08-0.35 M $_{☉}$) do not follow the same UV
        evolutionary trend as early-Ms. Lower-mass M stars retain high
        levels of UV activity up to field ages, with only a factor of 4
        decrease on average in GALEX NUV and FUV flux density between
        young ($\lt$50 Myr) and old ({\ensuremath{\sim}}5 Gyr) stars,
        compared to a factor of 11 and 31 for early-Ms in NUV and FUV,
        respectively. We also find that the FUV/NUV flux density ratio,
        which can affect the photochemistry of important planetary
        biosignatures, is mass- and age-dependent for early-Ms, but
        remains relatively constant for the mid- and late-type Ms in our

        of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs that is difficult to
        disentangle due to the lack of constraints on their age, such as
        trigonometric parallax, lithium detection, and space velocity.
        \textbackslash Aims: We search for young brown dwarf candidates
        among a sample of 28 nearby late-M dwarfs with spectral types
        between M5.0 and M9.0, and we also search for debris disks
        around three of them. \textbackslash Methods: Based on
        theoretical models, we used the color I-J, the J-band absolute
        magnitude, and the detection of the Li I 6708 {\r{A}} doublet
        line as a strong constraint to estimate masses and ages of our
        targets. For the search of debris disks, we observed three
        targets at submillimeter wavelength of 850 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m.
        \textbackslash Results: We report here the first clear
        detections of lithium absorption in four targets and a marginal
        detection in one target. Our mass estimates indicate that two of
        them are young brown dwarfs, two are young brown dwarf
        candidates, and one is a young very low-mass star. The closest
        young field brown dwarf in our sample at only 15 pc is an
        excellent benchmark for further studying physical properties of
        brown dwarfs in the range 100-150 Myr. We did not detect any
        debris disks around three late-M dwarfs, and we estimated upper
        limits to the dust mass of debris disks around them.

        red dwarf stars at optical wavelengths. The sample consists of
        264 M dwarfs south of decl. = +30 with V-K = 3.96-9.16 and
        M$_{V}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10-20, corresponding to spectral
        types M2V-M8V, most of which are within 25 pc. The stars have
        been observed in the VRI filters for {\ensuremath{\sim}}4-14 yr
        at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m telescope. Of the 238 red dwarfs within
        25 pc, we find that only {\ensuremath{\sim}}8\% are
        photometrically variable by at least 20 mmag
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}2\%) in the VRI bands. Only four stars have
        been found to vary by more than 50 mmag, including GJ 1207 at
        8.6 pc, which experienced a single extraordinary flare, and GJ
        2006 A, TWA 8 A, and TWA 8 B, which are all young stars beyond
        25 pc linked to moving groups. We find that high variability at
        optical wavelengths over the long term can in fact be used to
        identify young stars. Overall, however, the fluxes of most red
        dwarfs at optical wavelengths are steady to a few percent over
        the long term. The low overall rate of photometric variability
        for red dwarfs is consistent with results found in previous work
        on similar stars on shorter timescales, with the body of work
        indicating that most red dwarfs are only mildly variable. As
        expected, we find that the degree of photometric variability is
        greater in the V band than in the R or I bands, but we do not
        find any obvious trends in variability over the long term with
        red dwarf luminosity or temperature. We highlight 17 stars that
        show long-term changes in brightness, sometimes because of
        flaring activity or spots, and sometimes because of stellar
        cycles similar to our Sun's solar cycle. Remarkably, two targets
        show brightnesses that monotonically increase (G 169-029) or
        decrease (WT 460AB) by several percent over a decade. We also
        provide long-term variability measurements for seven M dwarfs
        within 25 pc that host exoplanets, none of which vary by more
        than 20 mmag. Both as a population, and for the specific red
        dwarfs with exoplanets observed here, photometric variability is
        therefore often not a concern for planetary environments, at
        least at the optical wavelengths where they emit much of their
        light.}",

        to be rapid rotators (v sin i $\gt$ 10 km s$^{-1}$), consistent
        with previous seeing-limited measurements of VLM objects. The
        two sources with the largest v sin i, LP 349-25B and HD 130948C,
        are rotating at \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\% of their
        break-up speed, and are among the most rapidly rotating VLM
        objects known. Furthermore, five binary systems, all with
        orbital semimajor axes lsim3.5 AU, have component v sin i values
        that differ by greater than 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}}. To bring the
        binary components with discrepant rotational velocities into
        agreement would require the rotational axes to be inclined with
        respect to each other, and that at least one component is
        inclined with respect to the orbital plane. Alternatively, each
        component could be rotating at a different rate, even though
        they have similar spectral types. Both differing rotational

        formation and evolution. We also investigate possible dynamical
        evolution in the triple system HD 130948A-BC. The close binary
        brown dwarfs B and C have significantly different v sin i
        values. We demonstrate that components B and C could have been
        torqued into misalignment by the primary star, A, via orbital
        precession. Such a scenario can also be applied to another
        triple system in our sample, GJ 569A-Bab. Interactions such as
        these may play an important role in the dynamical evolution of
        VLM binaries. Finally, we note that two of the binaries with
        large differences in component v sin i, LP 349-25AB and 2MASS
        0746+20AB, are also known radio sources.}",

        equatorial and orbital planes of systems with $\lt$40 AU
        separation. By comparison, the alignment of the equatorial and
        orbital axes in the substellar regime, and the associated
        implications for formation theory, are relatively poorly
        constrained. Here we present the discovery of the rotation
        period of 3.32 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.15 h from 2MASS J0746+20A -
        the primary component of a tight (2.7 AU) ultracool dwarf binary
        system (L0+L1.5). The newly discovered period, together with the
        established period via radio observations of the other
        component, and the well constrained orbital parameters and
        rotational velocity measurements, allow us to infer alignment of
        the equatorial planes of both components with the orbital plane
        of the system to within 10 degrees. This result suggests that
        solar-type binary formation mechanisms may extend down into the
        brown dwarf mass range, and we consider a number of formation
        theories that may be applicable in this case. This is the first
        such observational result in the very low mass binary regime. In
        addition, the detected period of 3.32 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.15 h
        implies that the reported radio period of 2.07
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002 h is associated with the secondary
        star, not the primary, as was previously claimed. This in turn

        therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a
        single population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both
        the BPMG and Tuc-Hor are consistent with recent lithium
        depletion boundary (LDB) ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are
        relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary

The sample of 1429 stars was identified from “The Catalog of Suspected Nearby Young Moving Group Stars.” Good-quality parallax and proper motion values were retrieved for 890 stars from the Gaia DR2 database. The analysis for membership probability is performed in the framework of the LACEwING algorithm. From the analysis it is confirmed that 279 stars do not belong to any of the known moving groups. We estimated the U, V, W space velocity values for 250 moving group members, which were found to be more accurate than previous values listed in the literature. The velocity ellipses of all the moving groups are well constrained within the “good box,” a widely used criterion to identify moving group members. The age of moving group members are uniformly estimated from the analysis of the Gaia color–magnitude diagram with MIST isochrones. We found a spread in the age distribution of stars belonging to some moving groups, which needs to be understood from further studies.}

        young ({\ensuremath{\tau}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40
        Myr) population of comoving stars. We also report observations
        for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type
        range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be
        unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new
        candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial
        velocities, H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, and Li$_{6708}$
        absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide
        members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known
        population by a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3 in
        total and by a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde8 for
        members with SpT $\gt$= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf
        population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded
        census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was
        previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears
        to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X
        and Y, but a very narrow distribution ({\ensuremath{\pm}}5 pc)
        in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small,
        with a scatter of {\ensuremath{\pm}}1.1 km s$^{-1}$ about the
        mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of
        Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age
        ({\ensuremath{\tau}} \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 20-30 Myr)
        and the lithium depletion boundary age ({\ensuremath{\tau}}
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 Myr) disagree, following the
        trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to
        yield systematically younger ages. The H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent
        width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters.
        We find that moving group members have been depleted of
        measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our
        targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band,
        yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F $\lt$ 0.7\%.
        Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection
        procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for
        activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of
        K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would
        have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX
        UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for
        youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we
        suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield
        $\gt$95\% completeness for {\ensuremath{\tau}}
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 40 Myr populations with GALEX

        and thus affect a wide wavelength range in the electromagnetic
        spectrum. While the coronal properties of flares are studied
        best in X-rays, the chromosphere of the star is observed best in
        the optical and ultraviolet ranges. Therefore, multiwavelength
        observations are essential to study flare properties throughout
        the atmosphere of a star. \textbackslashMethods: We analysed
        simultaneous observations with UVES/VLT and XMM-Newton of the
        active M5.5 dwarf CN Leo (Gl 406) exhibiting a major flare. The
        optical data cover the wavelength range from 3000 to 10 000
        {\r{A}}. \textbackslashResults: From our optical data, we find
        an enormous wealth of chromospheric emission lines occurring
        throughout the spectrum. We identify a total of 1143 emission
        lines, out of which 154 are located in the red arm, increasing
        the number of observed emission lines in this red wavelength
        range by about a factor of 10. Here we present an emission line
        list and a spectral atlas. We also find line asymmetries for H
        I, He I, and Ca II lines. For the last, this is the first
        observation of asymmetries due to a stellar flare. During the
        flare onset, there is additional flux found in the blue wing,
        while in the decay phase, additional flux is found in the red
        wing. We interpret both features as caused by mass motions. In
        addition to the lines, the flare manifests itself in the
        enhancement of the continuum throughout the whole spectrum,
        inverting the normal slope for the net flare spectrum.

        than the Sun, HD 114762 b, was detected with a minimum mass of
        11 M$_{J}$. The small v sin i {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0 km s$^{-1}$
        that is otherwise measured by spectral analysis indicated that
        this companion of a late-F subgiant star better corresponds to a
        massive brown dwarf (BD) or even a low-mass M-dwarf seen nearly
        face-on. To our knowledge, the nature of HD 114762 b is still
        undetermined. The astrometric noise measured for this system in
        the first data release, DR1, of the Gaia mission allows us to
        derive new constraints on the astrometric motion of HD 114762
        and on the mass of its companion. We use the method GASTON,
        introduced in a preceding paper, which can simulate Gaia data
        and determine the distribution of inclinations that are
        compatible with the astrometric excess noise. With an
        inclination of 6.26.2$^{+1.9}$$_{-1.3}$ degree, the mass of the
        companion is constrained to M$_{b}$ = 108$^{+31}$$_{-26}$
        M$_{J}$. HD 114762 b thus indeed belongs to the M-dwarf domain,
        down to brown dwarfs, with M$_{b}$ $\gt$ 13.5 M$_{J}$ at the
        3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level, and is not a planet.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Brown dwarfs (BD) are substellar objects intermediate between
        planets and stars with masses of 13-80 M$_{J}$. While isolated
        BDs are most likely produced by gravitational collapse in
        molecular clouds down to masses of a few M$_{J}$, a non-
        negligible fraction of low-mass companions might be formed
        through the planet-formation channel in protoplanetary discs.
        The upper mass limit of objects formed within discs is still
        observationally unknown, the main reason being the strong dearth
        of BD companions at orbital periods shorter than 10 yr, also
        known as the BD desert. \textbackslash Aims: To address this
        question, we aim at determining the best statistics of
        companions within the 10-100 M$_{J}$ mass regime and located
        closer than 10 au to the primary star, while minimising
        observation and selection bias. \textbackslash Methods: We made
        extensive use of the radial velocity (RV) surveys of northern
        hemisphere FGK stars within 60 pc of the Sun, performed with the
        SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence. We
        derived the Keplerian solutions of the RV variations of 54
        sources. Public astrometric data of the HIPPARCOS and Gaia
        missions allowed us to constrain the masses of the companions
        for most sources. We introduce GASTON, a new method to derive
        inclination combining RVs and Keplerian and astrometric excess
        noise from Gaia DR1. \textbackslash Results: We report the
        discovery of 12 new BD candidates. For five of them, additional
        astrometric data led to a revision of their mass in the M-dwarf
        regime. Among the seven remaining objects, four are confirmed BD
        companions, and three others are likely also in this mass
        regime. Moreover, we report the detection of 42 M-dwarfs within
        the range of 90 M$_{J}$-0.52 M$_{☉}$. The resulting M sin i-P
        distribution of BD candidates shows a clear drop in the
        detection rate below 80-day orbital period. Above that limit,
        the BD desert appears rather wet, with a uniform distribution of
        the M sin i. We derive a minimum BD-detection frequency around
        Solar-like stars of 2.0 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5\%.

        other point-like sources. The astrometric core solution will
        determine the astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and
        proper motion) for a subset of these sources, using a global
        solution approach which must also include a large number of
        parameters for the satellite attitude and optical instrument.
        The accurate and efficient implementation of this solution is an
        extremely demanding task, but crucial for the outcome of the
        mission. \textbackslash Aims: We aim to provide a comprehensive
        overview of the mathematical and physical models applicable to
        this solution, as well as its numerical and algorithmic
        framework. \textbackslash Methods: The astrometric core solution
        is a simultaneous least-squares estimation of about half a
        billion parameters, including the astrometric parameters for
        some 100 million well-behaved so-called primary sources. The
        global nature of the solution requires an iterative approach,
        which can be broken down into a small number of distinct
        processing blocks (source, attitude, calibration and global
        updating) and auxiliary processes (including the frame rotator
        and selection of primary sources). We describe each of these
        processes in some detail, formulate the underlying models, from
        which the observation equations are derived, and outline the
        adopted numerical solution methods with due consideration of
        robustness and the structure of the resulting system of
        equations. Appendices provide brief introductions to some
        important mathematical tools (quaternions and B-splines for the
        attitude representation, and a modified Cholesky algorithm for
        positive semidefinite problems) and discuss some complications
        expected in the real mission data. \textbackslash Results: A
        complete software system called AGIS (Astrometric Global
        Iterative Solution) is being built according to the methods
        described in the paper. Based on simulated data for 2 million
        primary sources we present some initial results, demonstrating
        the basic mathematical and numerical validity of the approach
        and, by a reasonable extrapolation, its practical feasibility in

        dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a
        resolution of at least R \&gt;80 000, and we measure its RV,
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, and projected rotation
        velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra
        and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the
        RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the
        CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information
        on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare
        our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where
        we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and
        signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the
        highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range
        700-900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally
        precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We
        demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount
        of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness
        of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s$^{-1}$ in very
        low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use
        of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier,
        the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph
        is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish
        between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class
        telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push
        the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3-4 m
        s$^{-1}$.}",

        dwarfs. For each new observation, we determined its radial
        velocity and measured its H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} activity index
        and its rotation velocity. Additionally, we have multiple
        observations of many stars to investigate if there are any
        radial velocity variations due to multiplicity. The results of
        our survey confirm that early-M dwarfs are
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} inactive with low rotational velocities
        and that late-M dwarfs are H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} active with
        very high rotational velocities. The results of this high-
        resolution analysis comprise the most extensive catalogue of
        rotation and activity in M dwarfs currently available. <P

        of 334 M dwarfs of spectral types M0-M4.5 populating the
        parameter space around the boundary to full convection. We
        obtain high-resolution optical spectra for 206 targets and
        determine projected rotational velocity, vsin i, and
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission. The data are combined with
        measurements of vsin i in field stars of the same spectral type
        from the literature. Our sample adds 157 new rotation
        measurements to the existing literature and almost doubles the
        sample of available vsin i. The final sample provides a
        statistically meaningful picture of rotation and activity at the
        transition to full convection in the solar neighborhood. We
        confirm a steep rise in the fraction of active stars at the
        transition to full convection known from earlier work. In
        addition, we see a clear rise in rotational velocity in the same
        stars. In very few stars, no chromospheric activity but a
        detection of rotational broadening is reported. We argue that
        all of them are probably spurious detections; we conclude that
        in our sample all significantly rotating stars are active, and
        all active stars are significantly rotating. The rotation-
        activity relation is valid in partially and in fully convective
        stars. Thus, we do not observe any evidence for a transition
        from a rotationally dominated dynamo in partially convective
        stars to a rotation-independent turbulent dynamo in fully
        convective stars; turbulent dynamos in fully convective stars of
        spectral types around M4 are still driven by rotation. Finally,
        we compare projected rotational velocities of 33 stars to
        rotational periods derived from photometry in the literature and
        determine inclinations for a few of them.}",

        magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic
        dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35
        \{M\}$_{☉ }$ (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully convective, and
        are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism than
        solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide
        insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are
        available for these stars at field ages. Using photometry from
        the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods for 387 nearby,
        mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, finding periods
        from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has stable, sinusoidal
        photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5\%-1\%. We
        find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25 \{M\}$_{☉
        }$ and an anticorrelation between period and amplitude for
        higher-mass M dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older,
        slowly rotating stars without H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission
        that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. We use
        parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, photometry, and
        near-infrared metallicity estimates to further characterize the
        population of rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is
        consistent with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and
        rotators have metallicities characteristic of the solar
        neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-
        velocity relations to estimate that stars with P $\lt$ 10 days
        have ages of on average $\lt$2 Gyr, and that those with P $\gt$
        70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr. The period distribution is
        dependent on mass: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators
        at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators
        have shorter periods. We find a lack of stars with intermediate
        rotation periods, and the gap between the fast and slow rotators
        is larger for lower masses. Our data are consistent with a
        scenario in which these stars maintain rapid rotation for
        several gigayears, then spin down quickly, reaching periods of
        around 100 days by a typical age of 5 Gyr.}",

     abstract = "{Stellar coronal activity has been shown to persist into the low-mass
        star regime, down to late M-dwarf spectral types. However, there
        is now an accumulation of evidence suggesting that at the end of
        the main sequence, there is a transition in the nature of the
        magnetic activity from chromospheric and coronal to planet-like
        and auroral, from local impulsive heating via flares and MHD
        wave dissipation to energy dissipation from strong large-scale
        magnetospheric current systems. We examine this transition and
        the prevalence of auroral activity in brown dwarfs through a
        compilation of multiwavelength surveys of magnetic activity,
        including radio, X-ray, and optical. We compile the results of
        those surveys and place their conclusions in the context of
        auroral emission as a consequence of large-scale magnetospheric
        current systems that accelerate energetic electron beams and
        drive the particles to impact the cool atmospheric gas. We
        explore the different manifestations of auroral phenomena, like
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}, in brown dwarf atmospheres and define
        their distinguishing characteristics. We conclude that large-
        amplitude photometric variability in the near-infrared is most
        likely a consequence of clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres, but
        that auroral activity may be responsible for long-lived stable
        surface features. We report a connection between auroral
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission and quiescent radio emission in
        electron cyclotron maser instability pulsing brown dwarfs,
        suggesting a potential underlying physical connection between
        quiescent and auroral emissions. We also discuss the
        electrodynamic engines powering brown dwarf aurorae and the
        possible role of satellites around these systems both to power
        the aurorae and seed the magnetosphere with plasma.}",

        of the rapidly rotating fully convective M4 dwarf V374 Peg, on
        which a strong, mainly axisymmetric, large-scale poloidal
        magnetic field was recently detected. In addition to the
        original data set secured in 2005 August, we present here new
        data collected in 2005 September and 2006 August.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashFrom the rotational modulation of
        unpolarized line profiles, we conclude that star-spots are
        present at the surface of the star, but their contrast and
        fractional coverage are much lower than those of non-fully
        convective active stars with similar rotation rate. Applying
        tomographic imaging on each set of circularly polarized profiles
        separately, we find that the large-scale magnetic topology is
        remarkably stable on a time-scale of 1 yr; repeating the
        analysis on the complete data set suggests that the magnetic
        configuration is sheared by very weak differential rotation
        (about 1/10th of the solar surface shear) and only slightly
        distorted by intrinsic variability.
        \textbackslash\textbackslashThis result is at odds with various
        theoretical predictions, suggesting that dynamo fields of fully
        convective stars should be mostly non-axisymmetric unless they
        succeed at triggering significant differential rotation.

        large-scale topologies varying from simple nearly axisymmetric
        dipoles to complex nonaxsymmetric structures, and from mainly
        poloidal to mainly toroidal topologies. After recalling the main
        techniques of detecting and modeling stellar magnetic fields, we
        review the existing properties of magnetic fields reported in
        cool, hot, and young nondegenerate stars and protostars, and
        discuss our understanding of the origin of these fields and
        their impact on the birth and life of stars.}",

     abstract = "{We report on radio observations of the M8.5 dwarf LSR J1835+3259 and the
        L3.5 dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, which provide the strongest
        evidence to date that the electron cyclotron maser instability
        is the dominant mechanism producing radio emission in the
        magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. As has previously been
        reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of
        100\% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected
        from both dwarfs with periods of 2.84 +/- 0.01 and 3.08 +/- 0.05
        hr, respectively, for LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS
        J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized radio
        emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and
        brightness temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron
        radiation as a source of this radio emission. The unpolarized
        emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs is also attributed
        to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become
        depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere,
        possibly due to propagations effects such as scattering. Based
        on available vsin i data in the literature and rotation periods
        derived from the periodic radio data for the three confirmed
        sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546,
        LSR J1835+3259, and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that
        the rotation axes of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular
        to our line of sight. This suggests a possible geometrical
        selection effect due to the inherent directivity of electron
        cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the previously
        reported relationship between radio activity and vsin i observed
        for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf
        LSR J1835+3259 to be $\gt$=0.117 +/- 0.012 R$_{☉}$. The implied
        size of the radius, together with the bolometric luminosity of
        the dwarf, suggests that either LSR J1835 is a young- or
        intermediate-age brown dwarf, or that current theoretical models
        underestimate the radii of ultracool dwarfs.}",

     abstract = "{The ultrafast-rotating (P$_{rot}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.44 d) fully
        convective single M4 dwarf V374 Peg is a well-known laboratory
        for studying intense stellar activity in a stable magnetic
        topology. As an observable proxy for the stellar magnetic field,
        we study the stability of the light curve, hence the spot
        configuration. We also measure the occurrence rate of flares and
        coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We have analysed spectroscopic
        observations, BV(RI)$_{C}$ photometry covering 5 yrs, and
        additional R$_{C}$ photometry that expands the temporal base
        over 16 yr. The light curve suggests an almost rigid-body
        rotation and a spot configuration that is stable over about 16
        yrs, confirming the previous indications of a very stable
        magnetic field. We observed small changes on a nightly timescale
        and frequent flaring, including a possible sympathetic flare.
        The strongest flares seem to be more concentrated around the
        phase where the light curve indicates a smaller active region.
        Spectral data suggest a complex CME with falling-back and re-
        ejected material with a maximal projected velocity of
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde675 km s$^{-1}$. We observed a
        CME rate that is much lower than expected from extrapolations of
        the solar flare-CME relation to active stars.

    Abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 mum), H (1.65 mum), and Ks (2.16 mum) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 sigma point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 sigma photometric uncertainty of <0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are <0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},

Abstract = {We present the first results from our high-precision infrared (IR) astrometry program at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We measure parallaxes for 83 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6-T9) in 49 systems, with a median uncertainty of 1.1 mas (2.3%) and as good as 0.7 mas (0.8%). We provide the first parallaxes for 48 objects in 29 systems, and for another 27 objects in 17 systems, we significantly improve upon published results, with a median (best) improvement of 1.7 times (5 times). Three systems show astrometric perturbations indicative of orbital motion; two are known binaries (2MASS J0518-2828AB and 2MASS J1404-3159AB) and one is spectrally peculiar (SDSS J0805+4812). In addition, we present here a large set of Keck adaptive optics imaging that more than triples the number of binaries with L6-T5 components that have both multi-band photometry and distances. Our data enable an unprecedented look at the photometric properties of brown dwarfs as they cool through the L/T transition. Going from âL8 to âT4.5, flux in the Y and J bands increases by â0.7 mag and â0.5 mag, respectively (the Y- and J-band "bumps"), while flux in the H, K, and L' bands declines monotonically. This wavelength dependence is consistent with cloud clearing over a narrow range of temperature, since condensate opacity is expected to dominate at 1.0-1.3 ÎŒm. Interestingly, despite more than doubling the near-IR census of L/T transition objects, we find a conspicuous paucity of objects on the color-magnitude diagram just blueward of the late-L/early-T sequence. This "L/T gap" occurs at (J - H)MKO = 0.1-0.3 mag, (J - K)MKO = 0.0-0.4 mag, and implies that the last phases of cloud evolution occur rapidly. Finally, we provide a comprehensive update to the absolute magnitudes of ultracool dwarfs as a function of spectral type using a combined sample of 314 objects.},

	Abstract = {We present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and Ï values for ultracool dwarfs. The templates are based on spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope. The spectral features and overall shape of the L dwarf templates are consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a radial velocity precision of Ë10-20 km s-1. We calculate bolometric fluxes (accurate to 10-20%) for 101 late-M and L dwarfs from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, SDSS spectra, and BT-Settl model spectra. We find that the z-band and J-band bolometric corrections for late-M and L dwarfs have a strong correlation with z-J and J-KScolors, respectively. The new Ï values, which can be used to convert HÎ± equivalent widths to activity strength, are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated SDSS spectra and the new bolometric fluxes. While the measured Ï values have typical uncertainties of Ë20%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding HÎ± can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. Our semiempirical Ï values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous Ï values for mid-to-late L dwarfs, indicating that the upper limits for HÎ± activity strength on the coolest L dwarfs have been underestimated.},

@article{Mann2015,
	Abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations have been hampered by these stars' complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and the Stefan--Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7--M7 single stars with a precision of 2%--5%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and Teff. The derived Teff--radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to 3%. We derive bolometric corrections to the V{{R}C}{{I}C}grizJH{{K}S} and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1%--3%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass--absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar Teff values by an average of 2.2% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},
